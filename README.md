I am Chaithya G R, a Doctral student working with Philippe CIUCIU at Neurospin, CEA Paris-Saclay.
I work with Inria in the [MIND team](https://team.inria.fr/mind/) and Neurospin in the [METRIC team](http://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/en/Pages/research_entities/NeuroSpin/unirs/METRIC.aspx)

The topic of my PhD is deep learning for joint optimizing k-space sampling trajectory and MRI reconstruction, particularly non-Cartesian MRI. This made me interested in all things connected to:
- convex non-smooth optimization
- MRI and healthcare, particularly trajectory design, sequence development and reconstructions
- deep learning

I like to write TensorFlow, PyTorch codes not only to write neural networks but also to build other related functionalities.
I particularly love to build onto algorithms to drastically speed up computations through GPU implementations or parallel computations, algorithmic development etc.
Open source is definitely my motto.
